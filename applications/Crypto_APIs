# VeChain Crypto APIs Grant Application 
## Project Overview 

- Project: Crypto APIs
- Team Name: Global infra Tech Bulgaria Ltd.
- Payment Address: 0x2e719afa1d0d1354414fdf41d909ab34ba8b48f5

### Overview 

Crypto APIs is a robust auto-scalable B2B suite, providing blockchain- and crypto-related products as a service. We are looking for funding to build five tools that we will provide to the VeChain community. As an infrastructure layer, our products significantly reduce the developers' go-to-market time, development, and infrastructure costs. We aim to make blockchain development accessible to everybody - from startups to financial institutions. With our products, they can focus on building applications, instead of worrying about DevOps/NodeOps, uptime, scaling, updating, security, etc. The new wave of customers we are talking with is mainly interested in developing DeFi and NFT dApps. 

Many of our customers have asked us to build tools for the VeChain protocol. The main driver behind our interest in VeChain is its focus on solving real-world problems such as supply chain management and business processes. What we also like about VeChain is the chain's ability to send 1000 transactions per second. As VeChain is an ETH fork, we will be able to apply our engineering experience with other ETH forks and quickly deliver useful products to the ecosystem.


### Project Details

Here you can take a look at the tools we will build for the VeChain community if we get a grant. In a second application, we plan to apply for a grant for our newest products, which are Dedicated Nodes, open-source KMS SDKs, and others. First, we want to build: 

- MPC-based Business Wallet: https://cryptoapis.io/products/wallet-as-a-service
Wallet as a Service is a digital wallet that incorporates the most advanced security and authorization processes existing today. It is MPC-based, utilizing TSS and Distributed Key Generation. Allocated on multi-distributed nodes, Crypto APIs Wallet as a Service can offer customers both server and mobile nodes. Multiple security methods provide regular monitoring, audits, and system checks. Webhooks functionality is embedded along with whitelisting, governance layer, quorum modification (M/N nodes), and more.

- Unified Blockchain Data: https://cryptoapis.io/products/blockchain-data
This is a solution for multi-chain applications. After integrating with it once developers can retrieve the most important data for the most common blockchains (unified endpoints). They get results for each supported blockchain protocol by changing only a single parameter. Users get both historical and real-time data, which can be unified, raw, read-only, or segmented. A quick response time of 25 ms is guaranteed by the scalable and load-balanced database where all data is synced and indexed. Users can retrieve information on blockchain data such as Blocks, Addresses, HD Wallets (xPub, yPub, zPub), Balances, Unconfirmed Transactions, Confirmed Transactions Uncles, Epochs, Tokens, Smart Contracts, Internal Transactions, Mempool, Fees, and more. 

- Blockchain Events (Webhooks): https://cryptoapis.io/products/blockchain-events
Users can subscribe to certain events and get a callback notification every time they occur. There is no need of hosting or maintaining any node and the average delivery time is estimated at 100 ms. Events could include: a new block that has been mined, new unconfirmed and mined transactions, a certain number of confirmations (blocks) for a new transaction, and more.

- Blockchain Tools: https://cryptoapis.io/products/blockchain-tools
These are tools that do not require any contact with the database, blockchain data, or the use of nodes. These Blockchain Tools include actions such as checking the validity of an address and fetching its type, preparing transactions, deriving HD (xPub, yPub, zPub) addresses, receiving and changing them, and more.

- Blockexplorer.One: https://blockexplorer.one/

About our technology stack, we have over 500 Microservices and over 3TBs of data (MongoDB). We utilize Kafka, Redis, Node.js, K8S, and many others.

https://developers.cryptoapis.io/technical-documentation/general-information/overview Here you can learn more about the technical documentation and OpenAPI 3.0 specifications for all Crypto APIs 2.0 endpoints. We have 170 REST APIs for different protocols, all listed and explained in the Technical Documentation. 

https://developers.cryptoapis.io/sdkslibraries Here is a link to the SDKs we have developed for 12 programming languages. Crypto APIs 2.0 Libraries include API endpoints, programming tools, and documentation. 

### Ecosystem Fit
Crypto APIs is on the road to becoming the most comprehensive blockchain development infrastructure product that makes building blockchain applications faster, easier, and much more secure. Other tools we want to build for VeChain as part of a second grant application are Shared Nodes, Dedicated Nodes, Staking Services, open-source KMS SDKs, NFT APIs. That way, Crypto APIs will provide a 360-degrees VeChain development tooling to blockchain companies.

Currently, we have 400 paying B2B customers using our unified endpoints. They will all be able to integrate with VeChain after changing just a few lines of code. Moreover, we want to provide VeChain with around 1 million transactions and 10 new business customers every month. This calculation is based on the typical trajectory after integrating other blockchains. We want to build 100 REST APIs for developers on VeChain. You can find out exactly what APIs we provide in our Technical Documentation. 

Our project has already been backed up by multiple renowned names. Among our customers are Ledger, Paypal, Rakuten, CoinStats, CoinSwitch Kuber, Nexo, Enjin, CoolWallet, Chainlink, Arculus, Exness, ALT 5 Sigma, NGRAVE, Prime Trust, Kinesis, Casha. On an institutional level, we have been trusted by the University of Cambridge, UCLA, NYU, and Stanford University. We have already received grants from several blockchain communities to provide our tools to their ecosystems, incl. Stellar, NEAR, Zilliqa, and others.

Crypto APIs has more than 160 endpoints, 40 team members, and 15K+ community members (registrations). The products support 12 blockchains with a lightning-fast speed of 25 ms average execution time. Since going live 15 months ago, we have synced 2M HD wallets, broadcasted 3M requests, and sent 20M callbacks, while monitoring 30M addresses.

Crypto APIs is one of the first companies in the industry that is ISO 27001:2013 certified. We always strive for the highest possible information security which makes us a preferred technological partner in the DeFi space.
